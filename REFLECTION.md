# Myndshft Applicant Take Home

## REFLECTION


If given more time I will:

	- Create the search bar for the patient to research on any of his attributes and make the result available on a page page,
	- Create and connect all the necessary pages to the database (I used SQL SERVER) and make functional the CRUD operations,
	- Also, handle correctly the patient partial upload information case.


* The Most Challenging part: Write the bash for the CRUD operation as shown in the example. To be hosnest, I do not have that experience.

* The least challenging part: Analyse the given data and find the appropriate tables (classes)
